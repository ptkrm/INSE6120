# INSE 6120 Cryptographic Protocols and Network Security 

## IMPORTANT

- Project Progress Report by NOV / 21
- Demo by DEC / 06
- Final Report by DEC / 09

## PROPOSAL


For this course, students can choose for their project to work either on a high-quality survey, or on the implementa- tion of some security-related idea. See below the the criteria for each option. Projects can be made in groups of at most three students. Important: please keep in mind that the proposals under Option 2 are restricted—the course professor reserves the rights on your development/analysis (but we will also help you achieve academic recognition for your work, if your contribution is significant).


0.2 Option 2: Implementation
For this type of project, students are asked to implement a working solution (in any programming language), to solve a security and/or privacy-related problem. A list of several topics is provided below, however, students may also propose their own idea (to be validated by the professor).


6. Free WiFi. Free WiFi hotspots have blossomed in recent years and are available in virtually every shop where a customer may consume something (e.g., coffee shops and fast-food restaurants), as well as public places (e.g., airports), including those by local projects such as the MtlWiFi project and ˆIle Sans Fil. How secure are these networks? What can a malicious user do? Also, these access points are sometimes privately owned, and owners may like to gather some information on its users. What do they gather? Do they inject content? Can you implement quick tests as an app to launch when connecting to a new hotspot to verify how dangerous it is? This project will require field studies.

## OBJECTIVES

-  _How secure are these networks?_

- _What can a malicious user do?_ 

- _These access points are sometimes privately owned, and owners may like to gather some information on its users. What do they gather?_ 

- _Do they inject content?_ 

- _Can you implement quick tests as an app to launch when connecting to a new hotspot to verify how dangerous it is?_ 

- _This project will require field studies._

## PROPOSED?

In this project I am not going to focus on how to perform attack against Wireless Access Point, the goal of this project is to evaluate how safe are these connection, We want to know if they are gathering information about us? Or injecting content to our browser? Additionally What can a malicious user can do? Can a malicious user eavesdrop our communication or alter it?.

- _Categorize how grade of security have a wifi hotspot and describe how percentage of hotspot gather information, how many inject any kind of contents (ads, javascript files, etc), how many use any kind of proxy to alter https communication (man in the middle), etc._

- _Create an evaluation plan to use it for performing my test against different hotspot._

- _Propose some recommendation to make user connection more secure._ 

## STAGES

1) Stage 1 - Research, Lab Environment and Evaluation Plan: Here I am going to collect all the information possible and decide what cause makes a hotspot insecure, conduct different Labs test to simulate various hotspot condition and start to elaboration my evaluation plan.

2) Stage 2 - Field Studies - Wardriving: start collecting Wireless Networks location to later pre select which wireless networks audit by different criteria, discard home wireless network (maybe by SSID or by Zone). Additionally here I want to select a couple of hotspot from different Chain Stores (McDonalds, Starbucks , etc) because I have a doubt is their wireless configuration is different by location or they have the same configuration.

3) Stage 3 - Field Studies - Conduct Test: Perform the different test against selected free wireless hotspots.

4) Stage 4 - Final Report: As stage name , write the final report.

## NEWS

NOV / 11

Dear All,

I have been receiving a few update reports in the last 2 weeks. It seems like most of you will benefit from a project progress report submission (by Nov 21).

Survey projects - mandatory submission with grading (5 marks): If you are doing a survey, please submit a report by Nov 21.  This report can be incomplete, but should have the overall structure of your report. The final report will be due on Dec 9. No presentation will be needed.

Implementation projects: Your can submit a progress report, but this will not be graded. You need to present and demo your work on Dec 6; this will carry 10 marks. The final report/implementation will be due on Dec 9.

This project update reports will primarily be used to give you feedback.

Please avoid plagiarism in your report. If you are not sure about something, let me know.

Thanks,

OCT / 03

Dear All:

Please note, we have office our tomorrow at regular time (12-1pm).

Last Thursday, I talked to many of you re: your project proposal. Please re-submit your updated proposal, if you have been asked to, by tomorrow (Tuesday) night. My TA (Xavier) will look into the updates, and may provide additional feedback.

Many of you have chosen to do a survey, even though some of you have little experience in reading academic papers. But that's your choice. At least, read the base paper (from IEEE S&P or ACM CUSR) completely, before you finalize the proposal. Also, include some related papers on your topic in the proposal - to show us that you actually searched, and understand a bit about the topic of your choice.

For those with implementation projects: yes, you can reuse any existing projects to build your tool. You have to acknowledge/mention the reused work in the final project report.

See you all tomorrow.

Thanks,
