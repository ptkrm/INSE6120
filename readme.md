## PROPOSAL


For this course, students can choose for their project to work either on a high-quality survey, or on the implementa- tion of some security-related idea. See below the the criteria for each option. Projects can be made in groups of at most three students. Important: please keep in mind that the proposals under Option 2 are restricted—the course professor reserves the rights on your development/analysis (but we will also help you achieve academic recognition for your work, if your contribution is significant).


0.2 Option 2: Implementation
For this type of project, students are asked to implement a working solution (in any programming language), to solve a security and/or privacy-related problem. A list of several topics is provided below, however, students may also propose their own idea (to be validated by the professor).


6. Free WiFi. Free WiFi hotspots have blossomed in recent years and are available in virtually every shop where a customer may consume something (e.g., coffee shops and fast-food restaurants), as well as public places (e.g., airports), including those by local projects such as the MtlWiFi project and ˆIle Sans Fil. How secure are these networks? What can a malicious user do? Also, these access points are sometimes privately owned, and owners may like to gather some information on its users. What do they gather? Do they inject content? Can you implement quick tests as an app to launch when connecting to a new hotspot to verify how dangerous it is? This project will require field studies.

## OBJECTIVES

-  _How secure are these networks?_

- _What can a malicious user do?_ 

- _These access points are sometimes privately owned, and owners may like to gather some information on its users. What do they gather?_ 

- _Do they inject content?_ 

- _Can you implement quick tests as an app to launch when connecting to a new hotspot to verify how dangerous it is?_ 

- _This project will require field studies._

## PROPOSED?

In this project I am not going to focus on how to perform attack against Wireless Access Point, the goal of this project is to evaluate how safe are these connection, We want to know if they are gathering information about us? Or injecting content to our browser? Additionally What can a malicious user can do? Can a malicious user eavesdrop our communication or alter it?.

- _Categorize how grade of security have a wifi hotspot and describe how percentage of hotspot gather information, how many inject any kind of contents (ads, javascript files, etc), how many use any kind of proxy to alter https communication (man in the middle), etc._

- _Create an evaluation plan to use it for performing my test against different hotspot._

- _Propose some recommendation to make user connection more secure._ 

## STAGES

1) Stage 1 - Research, Lab Environment and Evaluation Plan: Here I am going to collect all the information possible and decide what cause makes a hotspot insecure, conduct different Labs test to simulate various hotspot condition and start to elaboration my evaluation plan.

2) Stage 2 - Field Studies - Wardriving: start collecting Wireless Networks location to later pre select which wireless networks audit by different criteria, discard home wireless network (maybe by SSID or by Zone). Additionally here I want to select a couple of hotspot from different Chain Stores (McDonalds, Starbucks , etc) because I have a doubt is their wireless configuration is different by location or they have the same configuration.

3) Stage 3 - Field Studies - Conduct Test: Perform the different test against selected free wireless hotspots.

4) Stage 4 - Final Report: As stage name , write the final report.
