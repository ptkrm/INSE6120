Free WiFi. Free WiFi hotspots have blossomed in recent years and are available in virtually every shop
where a customer may consume something (e.g., coffee shops and fast-food restaurants), as well as public
places (e.g., airports), including those by local projects such as the MtlWiFi project and ˆIle Sans Fil. How
secure are these networks? What can a malicious user do? Also, these access points are sometimes privately
owned, and owners may like to gather some information on its users. What do they gather? Do they inject
content? Can you implement quick tests as an app to launch when connecting to a new hotspot to verify how
dangerous it is? This project will require field studies
